## About Me
I am an enthusiast data scientist and researcher whose interest is driven by societal impact. I firmly believe that data and technology can and should be used for the betterment of society.

My long-term professional aim is to keep developing and applying my analytical and programming skills to challenges in the humanitarian sector, by supporting decision-makers in their work of improving people's well-being and helping those in need.

Outside of work, you’ll find me on the court, on the bench, or behind the data — anywhere basketball is. I’m passionate about understanding the game from every angle and committed to continuously learning and sharpening my expertise.
